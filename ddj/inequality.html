	<h1>In Britain’s top jobs, women make the least</h1>
	<h2>by Jennifer Guay</h2>

	<p>Britain’s 14.2% wage gap for full-time workers widens significantly when jobs are ranked by pay disparity, revealing that women make the least in comparison to their male colleagues when they work in many of the country’s most prestigious, highly paid positions.</p>

	<p>In 2014, female brokers made 42% less than their male counterparts, according to the Office for National Statistics. Lawyers and judges faced a 41% pay gap, while health professionals earned 31% less than male colleagues. The top three professions in which women made the most, on average – a higher percentage than their male colleagues – are fitness instructors, water and sewage plant operatives, and archivists.</p>

	<p>“There has been a gradual change for women in education: they’re starting to do better in school, and in all levels of education. But we think it starts very early: the process of segregation,” said Vicki Belt, assistant director of the UK Commission for Employment & Skills (UKCES).  “Young girls still tend not to go into the areas of work that may create better job opportunities or be more highly paid.”</p>

	<p>According to UKCES, female students now outperform males at all education levels, from GCSEs to postgraduate degrees – but Belt says women still choose “more traditionally feminized” professions. Only 19% of computer science and 23% of engineering graduates are female.</p>

	<p>Consequently, women hold two-thirds of the country’s minimum wage positions.</p>

	<p>“This is such a big challenge because society doesn’t tend to point women in certain career directions. It’s just gender stereotyping, and I think that’s the biggest thing we’ve got to fight against,” said Belt.</p>

	<p>Despite stagnancy in pay parity, British women are carving out a space for themselves in the country’s top-paid positions. Statistics on 2013-2014 tax brackets reveal that more women than ever are taking on roles that pay over £42,000 annually: 1.2 million total, a 17% increase from the prior year. The number of men in the same bracket rose by 13%.</p>

	<p>Last month, David Cameron announced that government organisations and companies with more than 250 employees must publicly publish salaries by next spring, or face fines of up to £5,000. The initiative, which aims to eliminate the gender gap “within a generation,” still needs to be passed by both houses of the Parliament.</p>
