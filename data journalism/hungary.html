	<p1>With 31% of its total health budget going to pharmaceuticals, Hungary spends nearly double the OECD average on drugs. There are many reasons that could explain why a lower-income country is spending more than its wealthier OECD peers on medicine – but Hungary’s case is a unique one, largely due to the cancerous corruption that grips its health sector, a holdover from the state’s decades-gone socialist regime.</p1>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p1>In October 2013, the European Commission released a study on health sector corruption that linked Hungary’s tax-funded universal healthcare system to widespread bribery, illegal equipment sales, and unethical “authorisation and procurement of pharmaceuticals.”</p1>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p1>Of the Hungarians surveyed, 70% agreed that “giving and taking of bribes and the abuse of positions of power for personal gain are widespread among people working in the public healthcare sector.”</p1>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p1>Forty-four per cent of interviewees said that they had made under-the-table payments during hospital visits in the last year. The elderly and those in bad health paid the most.</p1>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p1>“There are certainly a number of countries – particularly during the economic crisis, and since 2008, 2009 – where the pharmaceutical sector has been one area where there is a need for more regulation and more controls put on pharmaceuticals, both purchasing and prescribing,” said David Morgan, Head of Health Accounts at the OECD.</p1>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p1>Since the economic crisis, health spending in all OECD countries has stalled – but low-income countries still have to spend a bulk of their budget on pharmaceuticals, for two principal reasons.</p1>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p1>First, labour costs are lower: doctor, nurse, and medical staff salaries swallow less of the overall budget. Second, every country pays a standardized price for non-generic drugs.</p1>

	<p1>Hungary’s pharmaceutical expenditure is the highest in the OECD, despite efforts decrease public spending. The country has cut mark-ups for distributors, introduced incentives for prescribing generics, and increased co-payment costs, which rose from 40% to 45% between 2010 and 2013.</p1>

	<br>

	<p1>Meanwhile, the number of practicing pharmacists has increased from 48 to 76 per 100,000 inhabitants from 2000 to 2013.</p1>

	<br>
	<br>

	<p1>According to Morgan, the reason for Hungary’s high share of spending on drugs could all boil down to the country’s norms: “Doctors, practices – the way that they prescribe drugs is down to some cultural factors,” said Morgan. “In different countries, you may go to a doctor and there’ll be an expectation for patients to come away with a whole list of drugs.”</p1>
