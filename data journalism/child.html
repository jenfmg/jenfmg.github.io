	<p>When it comes to laws governing the legal age of marriage, developed countries like the France, Ireland, and the United States have more in common with third-world states than their Western peers: with all exceptions taken into account, there are no strict laws protecting underage girls from child marriage.</p>

	<p>While archaic laws persist in the West, the real child marriage problem lies in the developing world, where one in three girls is married before her eighteenth birthday.</p>

	<p>“Economic aspects and poverty play a part, but there’s obviously an aspect of gender inequality that says, ‘Our daughters are not valuable enough to keep or invest in’,” said Lena Minchew, Program Associate at the International Women’s Health Coalition.</p>

	<h3>Minimum age of marriage, when taking into account all exceptions: pregnancy, parental consent, court or government approval, religious and/or customary law</h3>

	<p>Early marriage has devastating effects on girls: it causes physical and psychological harm, perpetuates cycles of poverty and abuse, and cuts them off from education and work – which, in turn, hinders global economies. The practice is most prevalent in West and Central Africa and South Asia.</p>

	<p>Even in countries that prohibit child marriage, exemptions are often made if the girl is pregnant, her parents offer consent, the court sanctions the marriage, or it is legal in the eyes of her religion or culture.</p>

	<p>“If there’s a law that exists at a national level and there’s a community law that contradicts it, or there’s a loophole – for example, if the legal age is 18 but parents are allowed to give consent below the age of 18 – it simply doesn’t work. Even if a law exists and it’s quite robust, if there is no way to enforce it we see problems,” said Anandita Philipose, Adolescents and Youth Specialist for the United Nations Population Fund’s West and Central Africa office.</p>

	<p>Evidence shows that the conflict and chaos wrought by the refugee crisis is further exacerbating the problem. In pre-war Syria, 13% of marriages involved an underage girl, according to UNICEF. By the end of the first six months of 2014, the rate of child marriage among displaced Syrian girls in Jordan was 32%.</p>

	<p>“Families feel like they’re protecting their daughters when they marry them off,” said Heather Saunders, Policy & Advocacy Officer at Plan UK. “Parents don’t feel that adolescent girls walking around are safe. They feel like a husband would protect their daughters… [Girls] are much more vulnerable in emergency situations to all forms of violence, including child marriage.”</p>
