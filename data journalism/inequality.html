	<h1>British women suffer the largest wage gap in these 25 jobs</h1>
	<h2>by Jennifer Guay</h2>

	<p>In the UK, female brokers, lawyers and judges face a pay gap of 42%. Health professionals, opticians and physical scientists contend with a 31% disparity. Photographer, shop owners and architects make 28% less than their male colleagues. The top three professions in which women make the most – more than their male colleagues – are fitness instructors, water and sewage plant operatives, and archivists and curators.</p>

	<p>Every year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes data on the British labour market, including the salaries men and women receive for doing the same job. The 2014 statistics, released in November, reveal that an average wage discrepancy of 14.2% for full-time workers persists in Britain.</p>

	<p>“There has been a gradual change for women in education: they’re starting to do better in school, and in all levels of education. But we think it starts very early: the process of segregation,” said Vicki Belt, assistant director of the UK Commission for Employment & Skills (UKCES).</p>

	<p>According to a UKCES study, female students outperform than males at all education levels, from GCSEs to postgraduate degrees.</p>

	<p>However, British women are vastly underrepresented in science, technology, and math: only 19% of computer science and 23% of engineering graduates are female.</p>

	<p>“I think it’s a real challenge because society doesn’t tend to point women in certain career directions. It’s just gender stereotyping, and I think that’s the biggest thing we’ve got to fight against,” said Belt.</p>

	<p>Women are less represented in the highest paying fields. Instead, they hold two-thirds of the UK’s minimum wage positions.</p>

	<p>Last month, David Cameron announced that government organisations and companies with more than 250 employees must publicly publish salaries as of next spring, or face fines of up to £5,000. The initiative, which aims to eliminate the gender gap “within a generation,” still needs to be passed by both houses of the Parliament.</p>
